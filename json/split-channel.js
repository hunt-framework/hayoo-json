          "description": "\u003cdiv class=\"doc\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis package provides an unbounded, imperative queue that is supposed to\n be thread safe and asynchronous exception safe.  It is essentially the\n same communication mechanism as \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eChan\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e,  except\n that each channel is split into separate sending and receiving ends,\n called \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eSendPort\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eReceivePort\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e respectively.  This has at least two\n advantages:\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e Program behavior can be more finely constrained via the type system.\n\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e Channels can have zero \u003ccode\u003eReceivePorts\u003c/code\u003e associated with them.  Messages\n    written to such a channel disappear into the aether and can be\n    garbage collected.  Note that  \u003ccode\u003eReceivePorts\u003c/code\u003e can be subsequently\n    attached to such a channel via \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003elisten\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e,  and can be detached via\n    garbage collection.\n\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy contrast,  \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eChan\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e couples a \u003ccode\u003eSendPort\u003c/code\u003e and\n    a \u003ccode\u003eReceivePort\u003c/code\u003e together in a pair.   Thus keeping a reference to a\n    \u003ccode\u003eSendPort\u003c/code\u003e implies that there is at least one reference to a\n    \u003ccode\u003eReceivePort\u003c/code\u003e,  which means that messages cannot be garbage collected\n    from an active channel if nobody is listening.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA channel can have multiple \u003ccode\u003eReceivePorts\u003c/code\u003e.  This results in a publish-\n subscribe pattern of communication:  every message will be delivered to\n every port.   Alternatively,  multiple threads can read from a single\n port.  This results in a push-pull pattern of communication, similar to\n ZeroMQ:  every message will be delivered to exactly one thread.   Of\n course both can be used together to form hybrid patterns of\n communication.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA channel can only have one \u003ccode\u003eSendPort\u003c/code\u003e.   However multiple threads can\n can safely write to a single port,  allowing effects similar to  multiple\n \u003ccode\u003eSendPorts\u003c/code\u003e.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome of the tradeoffs of \u003ccode\u003esplit-channel\u003c/code\u003e compared to Cloud Haskell's\n \u003ccode\u003eRemote.Channel\u003c/code\u003e are:\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e  \u003ccode\u003esplit-channel\u003c/code\u003e is restricted to in-process communications only.\n\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e  \u003ccode\u003esplit-channel\u003c/code\u003e has no restriction on the type of values that may be\n     communicated.\n\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e  There is a quasi-duality between the two approaches:  Cloud Haskell's\n     \u003ccode\u003eReceivePorts\u003c/code\u003e are special whereas \u003ccode\u003esplit-channel\u003c/code\u003e's \u003ccode\u003eSendPorts\u003c/code\u003e are\n     special.\n\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e  \u003ccode\u003eReceivePorts\u003c/code\u003e can be \u003ccode\u003e\u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eduplicate\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003ed\u003c/code\u003e,  which allows for considerably\n     more efficient publish-subscribe communications than supported by\n     Cloud Haskell at the present time.\n\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
