In particular the ability to cleanly access either a\n resulting value or exception.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere a methods to poll (with \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003echeck\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e), to block (with \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003ewait\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003etimedWait\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e), and to block and\n retrieve the actual value or rethrow the exception in the accessing thread (with \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eget\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e or\n \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003etimedGet\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e).  Timeouts are in micro seconds, values less than or equal to zero use non-blocking\n \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003echeck\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e.  The timeout should be detected reagarless of the blocking or FFI state of the worker\n thread.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn top of \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eforkPromise\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e is \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eforkPromises\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eracePromises\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e, and \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003edeclarePromise\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne can also manage the threadBy calling \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eabort\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e, which may cause the promise to store the\n exception from the abort as well as killing the worker thread.  The worker thread Id is a\n secret, this is needed to ensure the running of the continuations. The \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eabort\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e operation has the\n same synchronous behavior as \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003ekillThread\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote: There is no way for an outside thread to directly set the value of the promise to a\n non-exception value.  Using \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eabort\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e (or \u003ccode\u003ethrowTo\u003c/code\u003e with \u003ccode\u003egetPromiseThreadId\u003c/code\u003e) creates a race\n condition in setting the result of the promise.  There is no way to change the result of promise\n once it has been set.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe extension to the C++ standard is in the continuation attachment.  The \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eaddTodo\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e command\n will, while the worker is running, add the \u003ccode\u003etodo\u003c/code\u003e continuation to an internal list.  Immediately\n upon finishing the action the worker thread will always run through the queued continuations.\n Each \u003ccode\u003etodo\u003c/code\u003e will be run in its own forkIO thread (unblocked).  If the \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eaddTodo\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e command is\n issued after the promise value has been set then it simplify runs the \u003ccode\u003etodo\u003c/code\u003e in a new thread.\n Thus there is no way multiple continuations can interfere with each other, and there are no\n ordering guarantees between them.  The \u003ccode\u003etodo\u003c/code\u003e action will not be able to distinguish whether it\n is being run from the stored queue or immediately.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe use of \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eblock\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003efinally\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e should ensure that no matter how the worker ends the stored\n continations are run.  For instance: if \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eabort\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e is used then the continations might be run with\n that thread killing exception or with the custom \u003ca\u003ePromise.abort\u003c/a\u003e exception if no other result is\n already present.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne use case for \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eaddTodo\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e is to allow multiplexing.  Several promises could be given a\n continuation to write the results to an MChan or MVar, allowing another process to block waiting\n for the first one to finish.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
