          "description": "\u003cdiv class=\"doc\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecurely store hashed, salted passwords. If you need to store and verify\n passwords, there are many wrong ways to do it, most of them all too\n common. Some people store users' passwords in plain text. Then, when an\n attacker manages to get their hands on this file, they have the passwords for\n every user's account. One step up, but still wrong, is to simply hash all\n passwords with SHA1 or something. This is vulnerable to rainbow table and\n dictionary attacks. One step up from that is to hash the password along with\n a unique salt value. This is vulnerable to dictionary attacks, since guessing\n a password is very fast. The right thing to do is to use a slow hash\n function, to add some small but significant delay, that will be negligible\n for legitimate users but prohibitively expensive for someone trying to guess\n passwords by brute force. That is what this library does. It iterates a\n SHA256 hash, with a random salt, a few thousand times. This scheme is known\n as PBKDF1, and is generally considered secure; there is nothing innovative\n happening here.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe API here is very simple. What you store are called \u003cem\u003epassword hashes\u003c/em\u003e.\n They are strings (technically, ByteStrings) that look like this:\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cpre\u003e \"sha256|12|Ge9pg8a/r4JW356Uux2JHg==|Fdv4jchzDlRAs6WFNUarxLngaittknbaHFFc0k8hAy0=\"\n\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eEach password hash shows the algorithm, the strength (more on that later),\n the salt, and the hashed-and-salted password. You store these on your server,\n in a database, for when you need to verify a password. You make a password\n hash with the \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003emakePassword\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e function. Here's an example:\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cpre\u003e \u003e\u003e\u003e makePassword \"hunter2\" 12\n \"sha256|12|lMzlNz0XK9eiPIYPY96QCQ==|1ZJ/R3qLEF0oCBVNtvNKLwZLpXPM7bLEy/Nc6QBxWro=\"\n\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis will hash the password \u003ccode\u003e\"hunter2\"\u003c/code\u003e, with strength 12, which is a good\n default value. The strength here determines how long the hashing will\n take. When doing the hashing, we iterate the SHA256 hash function\n \u003ccode\u003e2^strength\u003c/code\u003e times, so increasing the strength by 1 makes the hashing take\n twice as long. When computers get faster, you can bump up the strength a\n little bit to compensate. You can strengthen existing password hashes with\n the \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003estrengthenPassword\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e function. Note that \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003emakePassword\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e needs to generate\n random numbers, so its return type is \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eIO\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eByteString\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e. If you want to avoid\n the \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eIO\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e monad, you can generate your own salt and pass it to\n \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003emakePasswordSalt\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour strength value should not be less than 10, and 12 is a good default\n value at the time of this writing, in 2011.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce you've got your password hashes, the second big thing you need to do\n with them is verify passwords against them. When a user gives you a password,\n you compare it with a password hash using the \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003everifyPassword\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e function:\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cpre\u003e \u003e\u003e\u003e verifyPassword \"wrong guess\" passwordHash\n False\n \u003e\u003e\u003e verifyPassword \"hunter2\" passwordHash\n True\n\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese two functions are really all you need. If you want to make existing\n password hashes stronger, you can use \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003estrengthenPassword\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e. Just pass it an\n existing password hash and a new strength value, and it will return a new\n password hash with that strength value, which will match the same password as\n the old password hash.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
