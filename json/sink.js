Like lazy I/O, a \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eSink\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e provides a\nway to obtain the value of the result of an \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eIO\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e action before the\naction has been executed, but unlike lazy I/O, it does not enable pure\ncode to perform side-effects. Instead, the value is explicitly\nassigned by a later \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eIO\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e action; repeated attempts to assign the value\nof a \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eSink\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e fail. The catch is that this explicit assignment must\noccur before the value is forced, so just like with lazy I/O, you\ncan't get away with completely ignoring evaluation order without\nintroducing bugs. However, violating this condition does not violate\npurity because if the value is forced before it has been assigned, it\nis .\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn practice, using \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eSink\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003es instead of \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eunsafeInterleaveIO\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e requires a\nbit more \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eIO\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e boilerplate.
