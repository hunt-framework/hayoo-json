Of course, messing\n around with URLs is all a bit inefficient, so if you already have e.g.\n hostname and path, or if you need more control over the request being\n created, then the underlying \u003ccode\u003ehttp-streams\u003c/code\u003e API is simple enough to use\n directly.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
