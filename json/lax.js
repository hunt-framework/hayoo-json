The resulting \u003ccode\u003e'A'\u003c/code\u003e will become &#8220;available&#8221; not until the action\n    \u003ccode\u003eputChar char\u003c/code\u003e has been executed.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn order to explain this, let&#8217;s think of \u003ccode\u003eIO o\u003c/code\u003e as being equivalent to \u003ccode\u003eWorld -\u003e Either\n    Exception (o,World)\u003c/code\u003e.  The \u003ccode\u003e\u003e\u003e=\u003c/code\u003e operator could now be defined as follows:\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cpre\u003e\n    io1 \u003e\u003e= io2Gen = \\world -\u003e case io1 world of\n                                   Left  exc         -\u003e Left exc\n                                   Right (o1,world') -\u003e io2Gen o1 world'\n\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis results in the following situation:\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e In order to decide whether \u003ccode\u003elooping\u003c/code\u003e outputs a value or throws an exception, the system has\n      to decide whether \u003ccode\u003eputChar char \u003e\u003e return 'A'\u003c/code\u003e outputs a value or throws an exception.\n\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e In order to decide whether \u003ccode\u003eputChar char \u003e\u003e return 'A'\u003c/code\u003e outputs a value or throws an\n      exception, the system has to decide whether \u003ccode\u003eputChar char\u003c/code\u003e outputs a value or throws an\n      exception (because of the way, \u003ccode\u003e\u003e\u003e=\u003c/code\u003e is implemented).\n\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e In order to decide whether \u003ccode\u003eputChar char\u003c/code\u003e outputs a value or throws an exception, the system\n      has to know if there is really a \u003ccode\u003echar\u003c/code\u003e to output or whether there is none because of an\n      exception. So it has to decide whether \u003ccode\u003eputChar char \u003e\u003e return 'A'\u003c/code\u003e outputs a value or\n      throws an exception.\n\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo we have a circular dependency resulting in an output value of \u003ccode\u003e_|_\u003c/code\u003e for \u003ccode\u003elooping\u003c/code\u003e.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eLaxArrow\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e type constructor transforms a given arrow into a new arrow which works mostly\n    like the base arrow but is &#8220;a bit less strict&#8221;.  To be more precise, all parts of\n    a lax arrow value which are constructed with \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003earr\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e are internally moved to the\n    beginning.  This way, data produced by such parts is available at each point in the arrow when\n    \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eloop\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e is used.  For the above example, this would mean that the result \u003ccode\u003e'A'\u003c/code\u003e is\n    already known before the \u003ccode\u003eputChar\u003c/code\u003e action is executed and can therefore be used by this action.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote that relaxation only works for arrows, not directly for monads.  It is unknown whether a\n    relaxation mechanism for monads exists but it is considered unlikely.  Of course, you can\n    transform any monad into an arrow by using \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eKleisli\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e.  However, the lax arrow type\n    is not an instance of \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eArrowChoice\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e nor is it one of \u003ccode\u003e\u003ca\u003eArrowApply\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/code\u003e,\n    and at least the current implementation does not allow it to be an instance of either class.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurther note that the implementation of lax arrows does not use \u003ccode\u003eunsafePerformIO\u003c/code\u003e nor\n    \u003ccode\u003eunsafeInterleaveIO\u003c/code\u003e and is not tied to \u003ccode\u003eIO\u003c/code\u003e at all.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe lax arrow version of the \u003ccode\u003elooping\u003c/code\u003e example would be as follows:\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cpre\u003e\n    looping :: IO ()\n    looping = runKleisli (runLax (loop $ second $ impure (Kleisli putChar) \u003e\u003e\u003e arr (const 'A')))\n                         ()\n\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
